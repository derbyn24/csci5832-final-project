on
the
second
day
of
early
voting
at
a
polling
station
,
Oct.

,
in

North
Carolina
.
Despite
concern
about
early
voting
access
after
Hurricane
Helene
,
many
local
official
report
record
turnout
for
early
voting
,
like
in
nearby
Yancey
County
.
BURNSVILLE
,
N.C.
—
Mary
Beth
Tipton
have
two
sticker
on
the
wall
in
her
office
that
sum
up
what
it
’
s
like

an
election
official
.
One
’
s
a
smiling
,
flame
cartoon
dumpster
that
say
in
all
cap
:
“
IT
’
S
FINE
,
I
’
M
FINE
,
EVERYTHING

S
FINE
.
”
“
The
other
one
be
a
circus
tent
and
it
say
‘
Ringmaster
of
the
’
...
we
'll
just
let
people
take
a
guess
...
'show
’
,
”
Tipton
laugh
.
She
’
s
be
the
election
director
in
rural
Yancey
County
,
north
of
Asheville
,
for
a
dozen
year
,
include
during
the
pandemic
,
and
think
she
'd
see
it
all
.
When
Hurricane
Helene
come
in
and
devastate
western
North
Carolina
with
torrential
flooding
,
everything
change
.
Yancey
County
election
director
Mary
Beth
Tipton
's
office
sport
a
sticker
of
a
smile
cartoon
dumpster
that
say
,
``
It
's
fine
,
I
'm
fine
,
everything
be
fine
,
''
which
have
take
on
extra
meaning
in
recent
week
.
In
the
final
countdown
to
Election
Day
,
the
presidential
race
be
top
of
mind
for
many
Americans
.
But
in
Yancey
County
and
across
western
North
Carolina
,
election
season
seem
like
a
foreign
concept
for
people
leave
pick
up
the
piece
.
Tipton
say
it
be
hard
come
back
into
the
office
the
first
time
after
the
storm
,
but
soon
after
she
walk
in
,
the
phone
start
ring
off
the
hook
.
There
be
question
about
how
to
send
a
ballot
to
far-flung
area
people
evacuate
to
.
There
be
preparation
to
make
and
poll
place
to
check
on
.
One
building
wash
into
the
river
and
others
be
use
for
aid
distribution
and
sheltering
.
On
the
first
day
of
early
voting
last
Thursday
,
voter
show
up
in
record
number
and
Tipton
quickly
remember
why
she
be
there
.
“
This
be
one
normal
thing
I
can
give
my
voter
,
the
one
that
have
lose
everything
,
”
an
emotional
Tipton
say
during
an
early
afternoon
lull
.
“
You
would
n't
believe
the
people
that
's
come
through
here
today
that
’
s
say
,
‘
I
do
n't
have
a
home
,
but
they
're
here
to
vote
.
This
be
one
thing
that
we
're
not
take
away
from
them
.
We
're
go
to
see
to
it
that
they
do
get
to
vote
.
”
Mary
Beth
Tipton
could
not
fathom
return
to
the
election
office
after
the
hurricane
sweep
through
North
Carolina
,
but
have
become
energize
by
help
people
cast
their
ballot
in
recent
day
.
There
be
11
precinct
in
the
county
with
various
state
of
readiness
for
November
’
s
Election
Day
,
with
assistance
from
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
and
some
distribution
site
clear
out
.
“
I
have
request
six
tent
from
FEMA
,
and
what
they
'll
do
be
they
'll
come
in
with
power
generator
,
heat
,
Porta-Johns
,
it
’
s
get
a
floor
,
it
’
s
awesome
,
’
she
say
.
“
I
have
to
find
a
footprint
of
60
’
by
100
,
so
that
way
we
can
set
the
tent
up
in
these
area
where
we
do
n't
have
anything
.
”
How
to
campaign
after
a
hurricane
?
You
don
’
t
While
there
be
Herculean
effort
to
make
the
voting
process
business
a
usual
,
campaigning
have
take
a
backseat
for
both
party
and
campaign
.
Driving
through
the
main
road
around
Burnsville
,
the
county
seat
,
you
see
more
logo
for
aid
group
like
Samaritan
’
s
Purse
than
candidate
sign
.
Many
that
be
n't
wash
away
in
the
storm
be
remove
by
local
not
want
politics
to
be
a
focus
.
Johnny
Deyton
be
chair
of
the
Yancey
County
Democrats
,
and
say
last
week
they
would
normally
be
call
folk
to
remind
them
about
early
voting
and
offer
ride
to
the
poll
.
“
The
way
it
be
now
,
we
have
no
telephone
service
,
no
landline
in
Yancey
County
be
operate
,
”
he
say
.
“
And
the
old
resident
of
this
county
do
n't
believe
in
cell
phone
,
so
we
're
have
a
tough
time
communicate
.
”
What
little
communication
that
have
make
it
through
have
focus
more
on
make
sure
people
be
safe
,
feed
,
and
take
care
of
.
“
We
vote
70-75
%
of
the
population
..
the
registered
voter
will
be
lucky
to
get
within
60
%
,
”
he
say
.
“
Because
people
do
have
more
concern
than
voting
,
you
know
?
They
're
still
without
power
,
still
have
a
tough
time
get
around
.
”
Johnny
Deyton
be
a
lifelong
resident
of
Yancey
County
and
chair
of
the
local
Democratic
Party
.
He
know
almost
all
of
his
neighbor
who
die
after
Helene
,
and
say
turnout
across
the
board
will
be
lower
this
year
.
Deyton
be
a
lifelong
local
with
tie
to
the
community
that
be
strong
than
the
bridge
and
deep
than
tree
that
be
wash
away
by
the
storm
.
He
be
one
of
several
people
who
gather
at
the
party
headquarters
last
week
,
to
take
a
break
from
the
new
reality
around
them
.
And
to
grieve
.
“
You
know
,
I
know
just
about
every
person
that
lose
their
life
,
”
he
say
.
“
There
be
good
friend
of
mine
.
They
be
part
Democrat
and
part
Republican
,
but
they
be
all
good
friend
of
mine
.
’
Politics
have
be
put
on
the
backburner
,
even
for
local
candidate
who
could
use
all
the
support
they
can
get
.
Jim
Parlier
be
a
Democrat
run
for
county
commission
who
live
in
an
overwhelmingly
Republican
area
of
this
overwhelmingly
Republican
county
.
But
his
campaign
and
his
viewpoint
didn
’
t
matter
when
it
be
time
to
clear
debris
and
move
past
the
bad
of
the
flooding
.
“
It
do
n't
come
up
,
”
he
say
.
“
I
have
farmer
neighbor
who
have
bulldozer
and
they
be
clear
the
road
and
I
be
pull
brush
from
their
chainsaw
.
We
do
n't
worry
about
who
be
in
which
party
.
”
You
could
call
the
shift
in
Yancey
County
bipartisanship
,
but
it
’
s
more
like
an
anti-
partisanship
that
will
likely
linger
far
beyond
November
's
election
.
“
I
really
think
that
because
it
's
go
to
be
a
long
recovery
,
a
couple
of
year
at
least
,
that
we
're
go
to
stay
together
the
way
we
have
,
”
Parlier
predict
.
He
say
he
want
to
run
for
office
to
help
people
,
and
he
’
s
be
hearten
to
see
how
much
the
last
several
week
have
be
neighbor
help
neighbor
go
on
with
cleanup
and
distribution
of
aid
.
He
's
worry
about
what
happen
after
the
outside
attention
wane
.
“
I
think
we
need
to
continue
to
feel
the
love
,
”
Parlier
say
.
“
I
think
we
need
to
realize
that
from
our
helper
,
both
here
and
from
the
outside
,
that
we
're
get
great
big
hug
.
That
's
what
all
of
u
need
...
and
certainly
me
.
”
Campaigns
pivot
to
GOTV
to
help
those
in
need
Hugs
notwithstanding
,
there
be
still
an
election
go
on
,
and
both
presidential
campaign
be
in
a
delicate
position
:
try
to
balance
relief
effort
with
encourage
people
to
vote
in
a
state
that
both
Vice
President
Harris
and
former
President
Donald
Trump
need
to
win
.
At
an
early
voting
site
in
Rutherfordton
last
week
,
Republican
National
Committee
Chair
Michael
Whatley
,
himself
a
western
North
Carolina
native
,
say
the
party
be
use
it
resource
to
reach
people
with
helpful
information
.
“
This
be
about
the
family
of
North
Carolina
,
”
he
say
.
“
This
be
about
the
people
of
North
Carolina
first
,
that
be
obviously
our
high
priority
and
we
'll
deal
with
election
a
a
distant
second
.
”
The
Harris
campaign
have
also
step
into
overdrive
to
deliver
supply
to
affected
community
and
ensure
people
know
their
voting
option
.
Even
though
well
over
a
million
people
have
already
vote
in
North
Carolina
,
and
even
though
the
North
Carolina
State
Board
of
Elections
pass
rule
to
make
vote
easy
and
more
flexible
in
western
county
affect
by
the
storm
,
Yancey
County
election
director
Tipton
be
still
worry
about
make
sure
her
voter
can
cast
their
ballot
.
“
But
actually
see
that
the
people
be
interested
,
see
them
show
up
and
see
them
turn
out
:
That
's
what
I
do
this
for
,
”
she
say
.
“
It
's
them
.
That
's
what
you
do
,
you
provide
it
to
your
voter
.
