# csci5832-final-project

I'm starting to draft my functions in a notebook just so they can easily be run and tested, but probably we'll have to migrate them to a regular python file eventually.

GUI Plans: my plan so far for the gui is that users will select whichever "mode" they want to use, and it'll display a sample output on the first sentence of the first file to show what the output would look like, then a user will hit run to analyze all the files. I feel like it would be nicer to see an example output before spending a lot of time running files. 

I'd also like to do a progress bar while the files are running if possible but tkinter is annoying to work with thus far so we'll see. 

TODO's (these are mostly for my benefit): 
-add code to copy a file to the input folder
-migrate code from the jupyter notebook
-finish the on button click logic
-finish up sentence detection, tokenization, word frequency, potentially chunking?
-make gui cleaner?
-progress bar??
